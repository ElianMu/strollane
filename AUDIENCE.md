# STROLLANE · NYC — who it is for

**Status: a design decision resting on a hypothesis. No user research has confirmed it yet** (see
`RESEARCH_PROTOCOL.md`). It answers the critique's question "What is important and to whom?" with a choice that can
be tested and, if wrong, changed.

## Lead audience: people new to New York

People in their first year in the city (new students, recent movers) who have free time and want to get to know a
Manhattan neighbourhood on foot.

Why this group, on the evidence available:

- **The product only pays off on longer, unhurried walks.** In the route benchmark (`benchmarks/ROUTE_BENCHMARK.md`),
  choosing a priority raised that dimension's route score by 4.8 points on average for trips under 1.5 km, where a
  third of runs simply returned the shortest route, against 10.8 points for 1.5–3 km and 14.8 points for 3 km and
  more. Someone going somewhere in a hurry gets nothing from it; someone with 20 minutes or more to spare does.
- **They do not already know which streets are pleasant.** A long-time resident has their own routes. A newcomer has
  the time and the reason to choose a street by what it is like.
- **They come back.** A visitor uses a tool for a few days. A newcomer explores for months, which is what a tool built
  on street-by-street differences needs.
- **They can be reached for validation.** A first round of 8–12 walk-along participants can be recruited among new
  students, so the trust question the critique raised can actually be tested with this group.
- **Coverage fits.** Scores exist for Manhattan only, which is where this group explores first.

## Use cases built around the lead audience

| Use case | What they do | Dimensions it leans on |
|---|---|---|
| Get to know a neighbourhood | Start from where they are, no destination, 30–60 minutes ("Discover for me") | Nature, Quiet & Relax, Architecture |
| Take the nicer way | Between two places they already go (home, campus, a park), accepting a modest detour | Quiet & Relax, Nature, Spatial Comfort |
| A walk with a point | A walk that passes a few places worth knowing (parks, museums, a café) | Culture, Food & Retail, plus the journey stops |

In the app these three are the first three buttons of the walk-priorities row (`walk-presets.js`, `WALK_ACTIVITIES`).
Each button only switches on the dimensions in its row above at the same weight a single pill sets (80); it adds no
dimension, score or route. Walk length is not a new setting either: with no destination the existing recommender
(`journey.js`, `prepareRecommendedWalk`) proposes a walk past real places, 60 minutes for a loop and 75 minutes
open-ended; with a destination the router goes there along streets ranked by those dimensions. The three dimensions of
the first use case (Nature, Quiet & Relax, Architecture) are also the first three pills; the other nine follow in
benchmark order and none is removed.

## Secondary audience: residents who walk for leisure

Same product, different entry: they mostly use "take the nicer way" between familiar places. Nothing extra is built
for them now.

## Not the lead: short-stay visitors

Visitors are landmark-driven and short of time, which is the case the benchmark shows the least benefit for. The
existing visitor features (hotel as a base, luggage storage, services) stay available but are not what the first
screen is written for.

## What would change this decision

- Walk-along participants who are new to the city do not notice or value the difference between the priority route and
  the shortest one, while another group does.
- New arrivals turn out to use it mainly for short point-to-point trips, where it adds little.
- Visitors, not newcomers, are the ones who return to it.
